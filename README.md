🧭 Career Compass – Project Description
Introduction

Career Compass is a web-based platform created to help students and young professionals figure out which career path suits them best. Many people finish school or college without a clear idea of what they actually want to do in life. This project aims to guide them in the right direction by suggesting suitable career options based on their skills, interests, and goals.
The idea behind Career Compass is simple — to make career planning easier, more interactive, and accessible to everyone.

Objective

The main goal of Career Compass is to help users discover the right career path by analyzing their preferences and strengths.
It aims to:

Provide personalized career suggestions based on user input.

Offer information about different fields, required qualifications, and skills.

Help students plan their education and training according to their chosen career.

Encourage self-awareness and informed decision-making for a better future.

Project Overview

Career Compass works as an interactive website where users answer a few simple questions about their interests and abilities.
Once they complete the quiz, the system analyses their answers and recommends suitable career options. Each suggestion comes with basic information like what the job involves, the skills needed, average salary, and the future scope of that profession.

The website has been designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make it simple, attractive, and easy to use. It focuses on user experience so that anyone can explore career options comfortably.
